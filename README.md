# Changelog Lint Action

This GitHub action brings the linter from the [changelog-utils](https://github.com/MalteHerrmann/changelog-utils)
to your CI workflows.

It's using [reviewdog](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog) to post comments on PR reviews that show any potential
problems with your changelogs.
